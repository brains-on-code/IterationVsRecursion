# Iteration vs Recursion

This Repository holds the aquired data from the Iteration vs Recursion study and the scripts to analyze it.
We aimed to look into the program comprehension process of novice programmers by using students as participants.
We used SoSci.Survey to make an online study due to the pandemic, along with this we used REyeker an Tool for tracking
the visual attention along the behavioral data.

You can find all the data in the "data/" folder. There you find an excel sheet with the raw data of the survey, and you can find
a '.json' with the used REyeker configuration.

In the "Two_Way_ANOVA_R/" folder you will find an R script for the used ANOVA test.

in the "REyeker-DataAnalyses-Python/" folder you will find several Jupyter Notebooks
used for preproccesing, analyzsing the click data and the behavioral data.
